          R. v. Green Mountain Jade Inc.: In September 2019, the Court delivered a decision regarding sentencing and
          delivered Green Mountain Jade Inc. a fine of $20,000 and took into account a $50,000 donation the accused
          had made to the deceased’s family.

          On July 20, 2015, an excavator operator was conducting trenching activities. During these activities, his
          excavator became stuck on the steep slope in that area. After unsuccessful attempts to free the excavator,
          he lost control of the machine while operating it down the slope. The excavator rolled, and the operator was
          ejected and sustained serious injuries. He was air-lifted to the Dease Lake Medical Center where he
          succumbed to his injuries shortly after arrival.

          R. v. Anthony Barry (Big Nugget): On March 13, 2020 counsel for Anthony Barry entered a guilty plea in
          relation to an offence under section 37(2) of the Mines Act stemming from a contravention of part 1.11.1 of
          the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in B.C.  Barry failed to ensure that all employees receive
          thorough orientation and basic instruction in safe work practices.  The Court imposed a fine of $7,500 after
          taking into account other payments the accused made to the family of the injured party.

          On December 31, 2016, an underaged worker sustained a transitory head injury and a shoulder fracture as a
          result of being struck by a falling tree that was being felled by an excavator operated by the permittee and
          mine manager Anthony Barry.
